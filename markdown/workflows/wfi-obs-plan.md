# RRN Science Workflows: WFI Observations Planning
This workflow is designed for users aiming to plan WFI surveys and observations by taking into account a number of design elements.


## Workflow description
- [RIST (Roman Interactive Sensitivity Tool)](../../content/notebooks/rist/rist.ipynb): Quick Characterization of Roman WFI Exposure Capabilities
> Get a quick idea of your exposure parameters using RIST. RIST helps users characterize the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) for one on-axis point source with a basic spectral shape (flat/A0V/M2V/G5V) and a given magnitude as a function of filter and exposure time. For more information, please refer to the [Roman Interactive Sensitivity Tool documentation in RDox](https://roman-docs.stsci.edu/simulation-tools-handbook-home/simulation-development-utilities/roman-interactive-sensitivity-tool).
- [STPSF](../../content/notebooks/stpsf/stpsf.ipynb): Simulate Roman Point Spread Functions (PSFs)
> Use STPSF to gain a detailed understanding of WFI PSFs. The tool simulates PSFs for various instrument configurations using a set of pre-computed Optical Path Difference (OPD) maps. It also includes field- and wavelength-dependent aberrations. Visit the [STPSF for Roman in RDox](https://roman-docs.stsci.edu/simulation-tools-handbook-home/stpsf-for-roman) to learn more about the software.
- [Synphot](../../content/notebooks/synphot/synphot.ipynb): Perform Synthetic Photometry
> Estimate the brightness of both empirical and model sources as they would be measured by the WFI. To learn more, refer to the [stsynphot for Roman documentation in RDox](https://roman-docs.stsci.edu/simulation-tools-handbook-home/simulation-development-utilities/synphot-for-roman).
- [Pandeia](../../content/notebooks/pandeia/pandeia.ipynb): Define the Exposure Parameters of your WFI Observation
> Refine your exposure parameters with Pandeia, the official Exposure Time Calculator for the Roman Space Telescope. Simulate multiple representative sources with given characteristics (e.g., Spectral Energy Distribution [SED], extension) over a small area of a representative WFI detector. Optimize your observing parameters to achieve the SNR needed to meet your science goals. For more information, please refer to the [Pandeia for Roman documentation in RDox](https://roman-docs.stsci.edu/simulation-tools-handbook-home/pandeia-for-roman).
- [STIPS (Space Telescope Image Product Simulator)](../../content/notebooks/stips/stips.ipynb): Simulate an Astronomical Scene Over the Full WFI Field of View (FOV)
> STIPS is designed to quickly produce image simulations similar to WFI exposure-level L2 data products. This tool is especially useful when Pandeia does not provide a sufficiently large simulation area. STIPS can simulate astronomical scenes as observed with the WFI over a full detector or multiple detectors. The software retrieves instrument and filter parameters for the WFI directly from Pandeia and approximates Point Spread Functions (PSFs) at any pixel location by interpolating over a grid of detector-specific PSFs generated with STPSF. The resulting flux measurements are within ~10% of those generated by Pandeia. STIPS allows you to create realistic astronomical scenes, generate input catalogs, account for multiple pointings, and understand the effects of noise residuals. User documentation is available at [STIPS in RDox](https://roman-docs.stsci.edu/simulation-tools-handbook-home/stips-space-telescope-imaging-product-simulator) if you would like to learn more.

## Caveats and Limitations
While the current content primarily focuses on the WFI imaging mode, more content on spectroscopic products will be available by summer 2025.
